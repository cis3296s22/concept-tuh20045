# Proof of Concept for Pac-Man
This document proposes an arcade game that most people may have played before. The Pac-Man game is a game where Pac-Man eats all his favorite snack pellets shown on the screen.


# How to Build
Prerequisites:
- MacOS, Windows
- A somewhat updated Java version should work
- IntelliJ

Edit the follwing instructions:
- clone the code from https://github.com/Gaspared/Pacman.git
- Go to Model class and loadImages() and delete anything before "images" to display characters.

Goal:
- Develop code to look like the original Pac-Man
- Reset everything but the score when Pac-Man has eaten all the snack pellets
- Fix the terrains to look like original
- Change ghost color
- Add large pellet snack. When Pac-Man eats the large pellet snack, he temporarily gains ability to eat the ghost or be invulnerable.

Time permitting:
- Develop code to make Pac-Man enter from right screen when he enters through the left screen
- Develop code for ghost to chase you on sight
- If ghost are eaten then it should display eyes which goes back to ghost spawn for it to respawn
- Rewind feature
- Show Ghosts Pathing
- Ghosts frenzy mode
- 1 or 2 ghost turn invincible (dissapears on map but hurts Pac-Man if collision occurs)
- Different version of Pac-Man (mouse, cheese, cat)

# How to Run and Test
- Run Pacman class to play
